Simple library for sending and receiving booleans, bytes, integers, and float variables over UDP. The esp32 can be connected to a wifi network or create its own hotspot.

If you set up port forwarding on your wifi router you can control your esp32 from anywhere!

Note: Communication with this library is not secured, don't use it to control anything dangerous or private.



[This](https://github.com/RCMgames/RCMDS) is a program that can be used for sending data to this library from a computer or Android phone.
